    I am 23 years old and have been employed in the pharmaceutical manufacturing field since I graduated from high 
		
school. My desire is to move to a career with more opportunities that is both challenging and rewarding, in a field that I 

will find more enjoyment in. I am excited to dive into the countless possibilities for my life in the software engineering 

field including the ability to continuously learn new things and experience a more flexible work environment. 


    I have been working on self-study involving HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Ruby, and SQL for just over a year, and 
		
honestly became overwhelmed with the sheer amount of information and vastness of resources that exist. I wanted to 
	
focus my efforts. I chose Flatiron for its value and the flexibility this program provides for me to learn an array of skills in 
	
a self--paced environment. 


    Since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by how things work and have been interested in building things. I 

enjoy the process of discovery and creation as much as I enjoy seeing the end-result. Even before considering software 

engineering, I was always looking at websites and apps and imagining new capabilities and features. I have enjoyed 

the challenges and complexities associated with certain software practices. The learning process can be stressful and 

hard, but it has also been some of the most rewarding work I have ever chosen to take on.
